ProFit AI: Student Personalized Fitness & Diet Planner
ProFit AI is an intelligent web application designed to solve the "one-size-fits-all" problem in fitness. Built specifically for students, it leverages Machine Learning to provide budget-friendly nutrition and personalized workout protocols based on body composition and available resources.

🚀 The Problem Statement
Most fitness applications provide generic plans that ignore:

Individual Student Needs: Variability in BMI and body types.

Cultural Food Habits: Lack of regional/affordable food options.

Resource Constraints: Student budgets and limited workout equipment (Hostel vs. Gym).

✨ Key Features
AI Nutrition Engine: Uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to recommend meals based on specific protein goals and budget constraints.

Dynamic BMI Analysis: Real-time physiological assessment that categorizes users (Underweight, Healthy, Overweight).

Adaptive Exercise Protocols: Automatically switches between Hypertrophy (Muscle Gain) and Metabolic Conditioning (Fat Loss) based on BMI.

Context-Aware Workouts: Tailors routines for Hostel/Home (bodyweight) or Gym (equipment) environments.

Portable Reports: Users can download their AI-generated plan as a .txt file for offline use.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.10+

Frontend: Streamlit (Responsive Web UI)

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (KNN, StandardScaler)

Data Handling: Pandas & NumPy

Model Persistence: Pickle

🧠 AI Logic Breakdown
The project uses a hybrid approach:

Unsupervised Learning (KNN): To find the "Nearest Neighbors" in the nutritional dataset that satisfy the user's budget and protein requirements.

Rule-Based Inference: To map BMI values to specific rep ranges and exercise selections (e.g., lower BMI triggers hypertrophy logic; higher BMI triggers fat loss HIIT logic).
